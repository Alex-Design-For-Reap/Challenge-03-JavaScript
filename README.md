# Challenge-03-JavaScript

This repo will be used to submit my challenge for week 3 and work on my first script.js code. The week's challenge required myself to modify starter code to create an application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. After adding and fixing the code, this app is now running in the browser and featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

## Description

- The motivation for doing this project is to get to know with JavaScript programming language and more than that, start practicing and becoming familiar with it, stablishing a solid foundation that will support me during my journey on this boot camp.
